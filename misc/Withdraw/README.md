# Withdraw.java

This readme gives some context to this problem, but it alsao for accurate documentation of this problem for myself. 

Here you'll find my code for one of the [qualified.io](https://www.qualified.io) problems from the 2020 Code 2040 application. This problem took me longer than expected adn is not pretty, but I'm proud of it because
(and I'm not afraid to tell) I never completed this portion of the process when I applied last year. 




## This is a growth problem for me. This is a starting point. 


#Thanks for reading.
