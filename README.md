# CodingPractice
This repo is full of problems from various practice websites. This repo differs from the codingSamples repo in the simple fact that these problems are not original ideas, nor problems presented in the classroom. These solutions uploaded here may or may not be entirely thought up by me and in general will be a little less refined. Enjoy!
